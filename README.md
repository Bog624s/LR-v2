# LoE Realm (Denver's Server)
This is the source code used on Denver's server of LoE Realm within 2016-17.

## About server source:
This project is based on FSoD (https://github.com/ossimc82/fabiano-swagger-of-doom).

I didn't developed this server source, just modified few things to make game like what I planned to be.
